\q1
\v 1 And he brought out of him a man of mercy,
\q1 Which found favor in the sight of all flesh;
\q1 A man beloved of God and men, even Moses,
\q1 Whose memorial is blessed.
\q1
\v 2 He made him like to the glory of the saints,
\q1 And magnified him in the fears of his enemies.
\q1
\v 3 By his words he caused the wonders to cease;
\q1 He glorified him in the sight of kings;
\q1 He gave him commandment for his people,
\q1 And showed him part of his glory.
\q1
\v 4 He sanctified him in his faithfulness and meekness;
\q1 He chose him out of all flesh.
\q1
\v 5 He made him to hear his voice,
\q1 And led him into the thick darkness,
\q1 And gave him commandments face to face,
\q1 Even the law of life and knowledge,
\q1 That he might teach Jacob the covenant,
\q1 And Israel his judgments.
\b
\q1
\v 6 He exalted Aaron, a holy man like to him,
\q1 Even his brother, of the tribe of Levi.
\q1
\v 7 He established for him an everlasting covenant,
\q1 And gave him the priesthood of the people;
\q1 He \f + \fr 45:7 \ft Gr. \fqa blessed. \f* beautified him with comely ornaments,
\q1 And girded him about with a robe of glory.
\q1
\v 8 He clothed him with the perfection of exultation;
\q1 And strengthened him with apparel of \f + \fr 45:8 \ft Gr. \fqa strength. \f* honor,
\q1 The linen trousers, the long robe, and the ephod.
\q1
\v 9 And he compassed him with pomegranates of gold,
\q1 \add And \add* with many bells round about,
\q1 To send forth a sound as he went,
\q1 To make a sound that might be heard in the temple,
\q1 For a memorial to the children of his people;
\q1
\v 10 With a holy garment, with gold and blue and purple, the work of the embroiderer,
\q1 With an oracle of judgement, \add even \add* with the Urim and Thummim;
\q1
\v 11 With twisted scarlet, the work of the craftsman;
\q1 With precious stones graven like a signet, in a setting of gold, the work of the jeweller,
\q1 For a memorial engraved in writing, after the number of the tribes of Israel;
\q1
\v 12 With a crown of gold upon the mitre, \f + \fr 45:12 \ft Gr. \fqa an engraving of a signet of holiness. \f* having graven on it, as on a signet, HOLINESS,
\q1 An ornament of honor, a work of might,
\q1 The desires of the eyes, goodly and beautiful.
\q1
\v 13 Before him there never have been any such;
\q1 No stranger put them on, but his sons only, and his offspring perpertually.
\q1
\v 14 His sacrifices shall be wholly consumed
\q1 Every day twice continually.
\q1
\v 15 Moses \f + \fr 45:15 \ft Gr. \fqa filled his hands. \f* consecrated him,
\q1 And anointed him with holy oil:
\q1 It was to him for an everlasting covenant,
\q1 And to his seed, all the days of heaven,
\q1 To minister to him, and to execute also the priestâ€™s office,
\q1 And bless his people in his name.
\q1
\v 16 He chose him out of all living
\q1 To offer sacrifice to the Lord,
\q1 Incense, and a sweet savor, for a memorial,
\q1 To make reconciliation for your people.
\q1
\v 17 He gave to him in his commandments,
\q1 \add Yes, \add* authority in the covenants of judgments,
\q1 To teach Jacob the testimonies,
\q1 And to enlighten Israel in his law.
\q1
\v 18 Strangers gathered themselves together against him,
\q1 And envied him in the wilderness,
\q1 \add Even \add* Dathan and Abiram with their company,
\q1 And the congregation of Korah, with wrath and anger.
\q1
\v 19 The Lord saw it, and it displeased him;
\q1 And in the wrath of his anger they were destroyed:
\q1 He did wonders upon them,
\q1 To consume them with flaming fire.
\q1
\v 20 And he added glory to Aaron,
\q1 And gave him a heritage:
\q1 He divided to him the first fruits of the increase;
\q1 \add And \add* first did he prepare bread in abundance:
\q1
\v 21 For they shall eat the sacrifices of the Lord,
\q1 Which he gave to him and to his seed.
\q1
\v 22 However in the land of the people he shall have no inheritance,
\q1 And he has no portion among the people:
\q1 For he himself is your portion \add and \add* inheritance.
\b
\q1
\v 23 And Phinehas the son of Eleazar is the third in glory,
\q1 In that he was zealous in the fear of the Lord,
\q1 And stood fast in the good forwardness of his soul when the people turned away,
\q1 And he made reconciliation for Israel.
\q1
\v 24 Therefore was there a covenant of peace established for him,
\q1 \add That he should be \add* leader of the \f + \fr 45:24 \ft Or, \fqa sanctuary \f* saints and of his people;
\q1 That he and his seed
\q1 Should have the dignity of the priesthood forever.
\q1
\v 25 Also \add he made \add* a covenant with David the son of Jesse, of the tribe of Judah;
\q1 The inheritance of the king is his alone from son to son;
\q1 So the inheritance of Aaron is also to his seed.
\q1
\v 26 \add God \add* give you wisdom in your heart
\q1 To judge his people in righteousness,
\q1 That their good things be not abolished,
\q1 And \add that \add* their glory \add endure \add* for all their generations.
