\v 1 He that lives forever created all things in common.
\q1
\v 2 The Lord alone will be justified.

\q1
\v 4 To none has he given power to declare his works:
\q1 And who will trace out his mighty deeds?
\q1
\v 5 Who shall number the strength of his majesty?
\q1 And who shall also tell out his mercies?
\q1
\v 6 As for the wondrous works of the Lord, it is not possible to take from them nor add to them,
\q1 Neither is it possible to track them out.
\q1
\v 7 When a man has finished, then he is but at the beginning;
\q1 And when he ceases, then he will be in perplexity.
\q1
\v 8 What is man, and what purpose do they serve?
\q1 What is his good, and what is his evil?
\q1
\v 9 The number of manâ€™s days at the most are a hundred years.
\q1
\v 10 As a drop of water from the sea, and a pebble from the sand;
\q1 So are a few years in the day of eternity.
\q1
\v 11 For this cause the Lord was patient over them,
\q1 And poured out his mercy upon them.
\q1
\v 12 He saw and perceived their end, that it is evil;
\q1 Therefore he multiplied his forgiveness.
\q1
\v 13 The mercy of a man is upon his neighbor;
\q1 But the mercy of the Lord is upon all flesh;
\q1 Reproving, and chastening, and teaching,
\q1 And bringing again, as a shepherd does his flock.
\q1
\v 14 He has mercy on those who accept chastening,
\q1 And that diligently seek after his judgments.
\b
\q1
\v 15 My son, to your good deeds add no blemish;
\q1 And no grief of words in any of your giving.
\q1
\v 16 Shall not the dew assuage the scorching heat?
\q1 So is a word better than a gift.
\q1
\v 17 Behold, is not a word better than a gift?
\q1 And both are with a gracious man.
\q1
\v 18 A fool will upbrade ungraciously;
\q1 And the gift of an envious man consumes the eyes.
\b
\q1
\v 19 Learn before you speak;
\q1 And have a care of your health or ever you be sick.
\q1
\v 20 Before judgement examine yourself;
\q1 And in the hour of visitation you will find forgiveness.
\q1
\v 21 Humble yourself before you be sick;
\q1 And in the time of sins show repentance.
\q1
\v 22 Let nothing hinder you to pay your vow in due time;
\q1 And wait not until death to be justified.
\q1
\v 23 Before you make a vow, prepare yourself;
\q1 And be not as a man that tempts the Lord.
\q1
\v 24 Think upon the wrath \add that will be \add* in the days of the end,
\q1 And the time of vengeance, when he turns away his face.
\q1
\v 25 In the days of fullness remember the time of hunger,
\q1 \add And \add* poverty and lack in the days of wealth.
\q1
\v 26 From morning until evening the time changes;
\q1 And all things are speedy before the Lord.
\q1
\v 27 A wise man will fear in everything;
\q1 And in days of sinning he will beware of offence. \f + \fr 18:27 \ft The remainder of this verse is omitted by the best authorities. \f*
\q1
\v 28 Every man of understanding knows wisdom;
\q1 And he will give thanks to him that found her.
\q1
\v 29 They that were of understanding in sayings became also wise themselves,
\q1 And poured forth apt proverbs.
\b
\q1
\v 30 Go not after your lusts;
\q1 And refrain yourself from your appetites.
\q1
\v 31 If you give fully to your soul the delight of her desire,
\q1 She will make you \f + \fr 18:31 \ft Or, \fqa a rejoicing to \f* the laughing stock of your enemies.
\q1
\v 32 Make not merry in much luxury;
\q1 Neither be tied to the expense thereof.
\q1
\v 33 Be not made a beggar by banqueting upon borrowing,
\q1 When you have nothing in your purse. \f + \fr 18:33 \ft The remainder of this verse is omitted by the best authorities. \f*
