\c 16
\q1
\v 1 Desire not a multitude of unprofitable children,
\q1 Neither delight in ungodly sons.
\q1
\v 2 If they multiply, delight not in them,
\q1 Except the fear of the Lord be with them.
\q1
\v 3 Trust not you in their life,
\q1 Neither rely on their condition:
\q1 For one is better than a thousand;
\q1 And to die childless than to have ungodly children.
\q1
\v 4 For from one that has understanding will a city be populated;
\q1 But a race of wicked men will be made desolate.
\q1
\v 5 Many such things I have seen with my eyes;
\q1 And my ear has heard mightier things than these.
\b
\q1
\v 6 In the congregation of sinners will a fire be kindled;
\q1 And in a disobedient nation wrath is kindled.
\q1
\v 7 He was not pacified toward the giants of old time,
\q1 Who revolted in their strength.
\q1
\v 8 He spared not those with whom Lot sojourned,
\q1 Whom he abhorred for their pride.
\q1
\v 9 He pitied not the people of perdition,
\q1 Who were taken away in their sins.
\q1
\v 10 And in like manner the six hundred thousand footmen,
\q1 Who were gathered together in the hardness of their hearts.
\q1
\v 11 Even if there be one stiff-necked person,
\q1 It is marvel if he will be unpunished:
\q1 For mercy and wrath are with him;
\q1 He is mighty to forgive, and he pours out wrath.
\q1
\v 12 As his mercy is great, so is his correction also:
\q1 He judges a man according to his works.
\q1
\v 13 The sinner will not escape with \add his \add* plunder;
\q1 And the perseverance of the godly will not be frustrated.
\q1
\v 14 He will make room for every work of mercy;
\q1 Each man will find according to his works.

\q1
\v 17 Donâ€™t say, I shall be hidden from the Lord;
\q1 And who will remember me from on high?
\q1 I will not be known among so many people;
\q1 For what is my soul in a boundless creation?
\q1
\v 18 Behold, the heaven, and the heaven of heavens,
\q1 The deep, and the earth, will be moved when he shall visit.
\q1
\v 19 The mountains and the foundations of the earth together
\q1 Are shaken with trembling, when he looks upon them.
\q1
\v 20 And no heart will think upon these things:
\q1 And who shall conceive his ways?
\q1
\v 21 And \add there is \add* a tempest which no man will see;
\q1 Yes, the more part of his works are \f + \fr 16:21 \ft Gr. \fqa among hidden things. \f* hid.
\q1
\v 22 Who will declare the works of \add his \add* righteousness?
\q1 Or who will endure them?
\q1 For his covenant is afar off. \f + \fr 16:22 \ft The remainder of this verse is omitted by the best authorities. \f*
\q1
\v 23 He that is lacking in \f + \fr 16:23 \ft Gr. \fqa heart. \f* understanding thinks upon these things;
\q1 And an unwise and erring man thinks follies.
\q1
\v 24 My son, listen to me, and learn knowledge,
\q1 And give heed to my words with your heart.
\q1
\v 25 I will show forth instruction by weight,
\q1 And declare knowledge exactly.
\q1
\v 26 In the judgement of the Lord are his works from the beginning;
\q1 And from the making of them he disposed the parts thereof.
\q1
\v 27 He garnished his works forever,
\q1 And the beginnings of them to their generations:
\q1 They neither hunger, nor are weary,
\q1 And they cease not from their works.
\q1
\v 28 No one thrusts aside his neighbor;
\q1 And they will never disobey his word.
\q1
\v 29 After this also the Lord looked upon the earth,
\q1 And filled it with his blessings.

\v 30 \f + \fr 16:30 \ft The Greek text of this line is uncertain. \f* \f + \fr 16:30 \ft Gr. \fqa The soul of every living thing. \f* All manner of living things covered the face thereof;
\q1 And into it is their return.
