\c 21
\q1
\v 1 My son, have you sinned? add no more thereto;
\q1 And make supplication for your former \add sins. \add*
\q1
\v 2 Flee from sin as from the face of a serpent;
\q1 For if you draw near it will bite you:
\q1 The teeth thereof are the teeth of a lion,
\q1 Slaying the souls of men.
\q1
\v 3 All iniquity is as a two-edged sword;
\q1 Its stroke has no healing.
\b
\q1
\v 4 Terror and violence will lay waste riches;
\q1 So the house of an arrogant man will be laid waste.
\q1
\v 5 Supplication from a poor man’s mouth reaches to the ears of \f + \fr 21:5 \ft Gr. \fqa him. \f* God,
\q1 And his judgement comes speedily.
\q1
\v 6 One that hates reproof is in the path of the sinner;
\q1 And he that fears the Lord will turn again in his heart.
\q1
\v 7 He that is mighty in tongue is known afar off:
\q1 But the man of understanding knows when he slips.
\b
\q1
\v 8 He that builds his house with other men’s money
\q1 Is like one that gathers himself stones against winter.
\q1
\v 9 The congregation of wicked men is \add as \add* tow wrapped together;
\q1 And the end of them is a flame of fire.
\q1
\v 10 The way of sinners is made smooth with stones;
\q1 And at the last end thereof is the pit of Hades.
\b
\q1
\v 11 He that keeps the law becomes master of the intent thereof;
\q1 And the end of the fear of the Lord is wisdom.
\q1
\v 12 He that is not clever will not be instructed;
\q1 And there is a cleverness which makes bitterness to abound.
\q1
\v 13 The knowledge of a wise man will be made to abound as a flood;
\q1 And his counsel as a fountain of life.
\q1
\v 14 The inward parts of a fool are like a broken vessel;
\q1 And he will hold no knowledge.
\b
\q1
\v 15 If a man of knowledge hear a wise word,
\q1 He will commend it, and add to it:
\q1 The dissolute man hears it, and it displeases him,
\q1 And he puts it away behind his back.
\q1
\v 16 The discourse of a fool is like a burden in the way;
\q1 But grace will be found on the lips of the wise.
\q1
\v 17 The mouth of the prudent man will be sought for in the congregation;
\q1 And they will ponder his words in their heart.
\b
\q1
\v 18 As a house that is destroyed, so is wisdom to a fool;
\q1 And the knowledge of an unwise man is \add as \add* \f + \fr 21:18 \ft Gr. \fqa unexamined words. \f* talk without sense.
\q1
\v 19 Instruction is \add as \add* fetters on the feet of an unwise man,
\q1 And as manacles on the right hand.
\q1
\v 20 A fool lifts up his voice with laughter;
\q1 But a clever man will scarce smile quietly.
\q1
\v 21 Instruction is to a prudent man as an ornament of gold,
\q1 And as a bracelet upon his right arm.
\b
\q1
\v 22 The foot of a fool is soon in \add another man’s \add* house;
\q1 But a man of experience will be ashamed of entering.
\q1
\v 23 A foolish man peeps in from the door of \add another man’s \add* house;
\q1 But a man that is instructed will stand without.
\q1
\v 24 It is a lack of instruction in a man to listen at the door;
\q1 But the prudent man will be grieved with the disgrace.
\q1
\v 25 \f + \fr 21:25 \ft The text seems to be uncertain. \f* The lips of strangers will be grieved at these things;
\q1 But the words of prudent men will be weighed in the balance.
\b
\q1
\v 26 The heart of fools is in their mouth;
\q1 But the mouth of wise men is their heart.
\q1
\v 27 When the ungodly curses Satan,
\q1 He curses his own soul.
\q1
\v 28 A whisperer defiles his own soul,
\q1 And will be hated wherever he travels.
