\c 26
\q1
\v 1 Happy is the husband of a good wife;
\q1 And the number of his days will be doubled.
\q1
\v 2 A brave woman rejoices her husband;
\q1 And he will fulfill his years in peace.
\q1
\v 3 A good wife is a good portion:
\q1 She will be given in the portion of such as fear the Lord.
\q1
\v 4 Whether a man be rich or poor,
\q1 A good heart \add makes \add* at all times a cheerful countenance.
\b
\q1
\v 5 Of three things my heart was afraid;
\q1 And concerning the fourth \f + \fr 26:5 \ft Gr. \fqa countenance. \f* kind I made supplication:
\q1 The slander of a city, and the assembly of a multitude, and a false accusation:
\q1 All these are more grievous than death.
\q1
\v 6 A grief of heart and sorrow is a woman that is jealous of \add another \add* woman,
\q1 And the scourge of a tongue communicating to all.
\q1
\v 7 A wicked woman is \add as \add* a yoke of oxen shaken to and fro:
\q1 He that takes hold of her is as one that grasps a scorpion.
\q1
\v 8 A drunken woman \add causes \add* great wrath;
\q1 And she will not cover her own shame.
\q1
\v 9 The whoredom of a woman is in the lifting up of her eyes;
\q1 And it will be known by her eyelids.
\q1
\v 10 Keep strict watch on a headstrong daughter,
\q1 Lest she find liberty for herself, and use it.
\q1
\v 11 Look well after an impudent eye;
\q1 And marvel not if it trespass against you.
\q1
\v 12 She will open her mouth, as a thirsty traveller,
\q1 And drink of every water that is near:
\q1 She will sit down at every post,
\q1 And open her quiver against \add any \add* arrow.
\b
\q1
\v 13 The grace of a wife will delight her husband;
\q1 And her knowledge will fatten his bones.
\q1
\v 14 A silent woman is a gift of the Lord;
\q1 And there is nothing so much worth as a well-instructed soul.
\q1
\v 15 A shamefast woman is grace upon grace;
\q1 And there is no \f + \fr 26:15 \ft Gr. \fqa weight. \f* price worthy of a continent soul.
\q1
\v 16 As the sun when it arises in the highest places of the Lord,
\q1 So is the beauty of a good wife in the ordering of \f + \fr 26:16 \ft Gr. \fqa his. \f* a manâ€™s house.
\q1
\v 17 As the lamp that shines upon the holy candlestick,
\q1 So is the beauty of the face in ripe age.
\q1
\v 18 As the golden pillars are upon a base of silver,
\q1 So are beautiful feet with the breasts of one that is steadfast.
\v 19-27 \f + \fr 26:19-27 \ft Verses 19-27 are omitted by the best authorities. \f*
\b
\q1
\v 28 For two things my heart is grieved;
\q1 And for the third anger comes upon me:
\q1 A man of war that suffers for poverty;
\q1 And men of understanding that are counted as refuse:
\q1 One that turns back from righteousness to sin;
\q1 The Lord will prepare him for the sword.
\b
\q1
\v 29 A merchant shall hardly keep himself from wrong doing;
\q1 And a huckster will not be acquitted of sin.
