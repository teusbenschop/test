\c 15
\q1
\v 1 He that fears the Lord will do this;
\q1 And he that has possession of the law will obtain her.
\q1
\v 2 And as a mother shall she meet him,
\q1 And receive him as a wife married in her virginity.
\q1
\v 3 She will feed him with bread of understanding,
\q1 And give him water of wisdom to drink.
\q1
\v 4 He will be stayed upon her, and will not be moved;
\q1 And will rely upon her, and will not be confounded.
\q1
\v 5 And she will exalt him above his neighbors;
\q1 And she will open his mouth in the midst of the congregation.
\q1
\v 6 He will inherit joy, and a crown of gladness,
\q1 And an everlasting name.
\q1
\v 7 Foolish men will not obtain her;
\q1 And sinners will not see her.
\q1
\v 8 She is far from pride;
\q1 And liars will not remember her.
\q1
\v 9 Praise is not comely in the mouth of a sinner;
\q1 For it was not sent him from the Lord.
\q1
\v 10 For praise will be spoken in wisdom;
\q1 And the Lord will prosper it.
\b
\q1
\v 11 Don’t say you, It is through the Lord that I fell away;
\q1 For you shall not do the things that he hates.
\q1
\v 12 Don’t say you, It is he that caused me to err;
\q1 For he has no need of a sinful man.
\q1
\v 13 The Lord hates every abomination;
\q1 And those who fear him love it not.
\q1
\v 14 He himself made man from the beginning,
\q1 And left him in the hand of his own counsel.
\q1
\v 15 If you will, you shall keep the commandments;
\q1 And to perform faithfulness is of \add your own \add* good pleasure.
\q1
\v 16 He has set fire and water before you:
\q1 You will stretch forth your hand to whichever you will.
\q1
\v 17 Before man is life and death;
\q1 And whichever he likes, it shall be given him.
\q1
\v 18 For great is the wisdom of the Lord:
\q1 He is mighty in power, and sees all things;
\q1
\v 19 And his eyes are upon those who fear him;
\q1 And he will take knowledge of every work of man.
\q1
\v 20 He has not commanded any man to be ungodly;
\q1 And he has not given any man licence to sin.
