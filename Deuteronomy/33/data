\v 10 They shall teach Jacob your ordinances,
\q2 and Israel your law.
\q1 They shall put incense before you,
\q2 and whole burnt offering on your altar.

\v 16 for the precious things of the earth and its fullness,
\q2 the good will of him who lived in the bush.\f + \fr 33:16 \ft i.e., the burning bush of Exodus 3:3-4.\f*
\q1 Let this come on the head of Joseph,
\q2 on the crown of the head of him who was separated from his brothers.

\v 17 Majesty belongs to the firstborn of his herd.

\q2 They are the thousands of Manasseh.”
\p
\v 18 About Zebulun he said,
\q1 “Rejoice, Zebulun, in your going out;
\q2 and Issachar, in your tents.

\q2 the hidden treasures of the sand.”
\p

\q2 As your days, so your strength will be.
\b
\q1
\v 26 “There is no one like God, Jeshurun,
\q2 who rides on the heavens for your help,
\q2 in his excellency on the skies.
\q1
\v 27 The eternal God is your dwelling place.
\q2 Underneath are the everlasting arms.
\q1 He thrust out the enemy from before you,
\q2 and said, ‘Destroy!’
\q1
\v 28 Israel dwells in safety,
\q2 the fountain of Jacob alone,
\q1 In a land of grain and new wine.
