\v 1 \wj “I am the true vine, and my Father is the farmer. \wj*
\v 2 \wj Every branch in me that doesn’t bear fruit, he takes away. Every branch that bears fruit, he prunes, that it may bear more fruit. \wj*
\v 3 \wj You are already pruned clean because of the word which I have spoken to you. \wj*
\v 4 \wj Remain in me, and I in you. As the branch can’t bear fruit by itself unless it remains in the vine, so neither can you, unless you remain in me. \wj*
\v 5 \wj I am the vine. You are the branches. He who remains in me and I in him bears much fruit, for apart from me you can do nothing. \wj*
\v 6 \wj If a man doesn’t remain in me, he is thrown out as a branch and is withered; and they gather them, throw them into the fire, and they are burned. \wj*
\v 7 \wj If you remain in me, and my words remain in you, you will ask whatever you desire, and it will be done for you.\wj*
\p
\v 8 \wj “In this my Father is glorified, that you bear much fruit; and so you will be my disciples. \wj*
\v 9 \wj Even as the Father has loved me, I also have loved you. Remain in my love. \wj*
\v 10 \wj If you keep my commandments, you will remain in my love; even as I have kept my Father’s commandments, and remain in his love. \wj*
\v 11 \wj I have spoken these things to you, that my joy may remain in you, and that your joy may be made full.\wj*
\p
\v 12 \wj “This is my commandment, that you love one another, even as I have loved you. \wj*
\v 13 \wj Greater love has no one than this, that someone lay down his life for his friends. \wj*
\v 14 \wj You are my friends, if you do whatever I command you. \wj*
\v 15 \wj No longer do I call you servants, for the servant doesn’t know what his lord does. But I have called you friends, for everything that I heard from my Father, I have made known to you. \wj*
\v 16 \wj You didn’t choose me, but I chose you and appointed you, that you should go and bear fruit, and that your fruit should remain; that whatever you will ask of the Father in my name, he may give it to you.\wj*
\p
\v 17 \wj “I command these things to you, that you may love one another. \wj*
\v 18 \wj If the world hates you, you know that it has hated me before it hated you. \wj*
\v 19 \wj If you were of the world, the world would love its own. But because you are not of the world, since I chose you out of the world, therefore the world hates you. \wj*
\v 20 \wj Remember the word that I said to you: ‘A servant is not greater than his lord.’\wj*\x + \xo 15:20 \xt John 13:16\x* \wj If they persecuted me, they will also persecute you. If they kept my word, they will also keep yours. \wj*
\v 21 \wj But they will do all these things to you for my name’s sake, because they don’t know him who sent me. \wj*
\v 22 \wj If I had not come and spoken to them, they would not have had sin; but now they have no excuse for their sin. \wj*
\v 23 \wj He who hates me, hates my Father also. \wj*
\v 24 \wj If I hadn’t done among them the works which no one else did, they wouldn’t have had sin. But now they have seen and also hated both me and my Father. \wj*
\v 25 \wj But this happened so that the word may be fulfilled which was written in their law, ‘They hated me without a cause.’\wj*\x + \xo 15:25 \xt Psalm 35:19; 69:4\x*

\v 26 \wj “When the Counselor\wj*\f + \fr 15:26 \ft Greek Parakletos: Counselor, Helper, Advocate, Intercessor, and Comforter.\f* \wj has come, whom I will send to you from the Father, the Spirit of truth, who proceeds from the Father, he will testify about me. \wj*
\v 27 \wj You will also testify, because you have been with me from the beginning.\wj*
