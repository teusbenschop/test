\v 1 Paul and Timothy, servants of Jesus Christ;
\p To all the saints in Christ Jesus who are at Philippi, with the overseers \f + \fr 1:1 \ft or, superintendents, or bishops\f* and servants:\f + \fr 1:1 \ft Or, deacons\f*
\v 2 Grace to you, and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
\v 3 I thank my God whenever I remember you,
\v 4 always in every request of mine on behalf of you all, making my requests with joy,
\v 5 for your partnership\f + \fr 1:5 \ft The word translated “partnership” (κοινωνίᾳ) also means “fellowship” and “sharing”.\f* in furtherance of the Good News from the first day until now;
\v 6 being confident of this very thing, that he who began a good work in you will complete it until the day of Jesus Christ.
\v 7 It is even right for me to think this way on behalf of all of you, because I have you in my heart, because both in my bonds and in the defense and confirmation of the Good News, you all are partakers with me of grace.
\v 8 For God is my witness, how I long after all of you in the tender mercies of Christ Jesus.
\p
\v 9 This I pray, that your love may abound yet more and more in knowledge and all discernment,
\v 10 so that you may approve the things that are excellent, that you may be sincere and without offense to the day of Christ,
\v 11 being filled with the fruits of righteousness, which are through Jesus Christ, to the glory and praise of God.
\p
\v 12 Now I desire to have you know, brothers,\f + \fr 1:12 \ft The word for “brothers” here and where context allows may also be correctly translated “brothers and sisters” or “siblings.”\f* that the things which happened to me have turned out rather to the progress of the Good News,
\v 13 so that it became evident to the whole palace\f + \fr 1:13 \ft or, praetorian \f* guard, and to all the rest, that my bonds are in Christ,
\v 14 and that most of the brothers in the Lord, being confident through my bonds, are more abundantly bold to speak the word of God without fear.
\v 15 Some indeed preach Christ even out of envy and strife, and some also out of good will.
\v 16 The former insincerely preach Christ from selfish ambition, thinking that they add affliction to my chains;
\v 17 but the latter out of love, knowing that I am appointed for the defense of the Good News.
\p
\v 18 What does it matter? Only that in every way, whether in pretense or in truth, Christ is proclaimed. I rejoice in this, yes, and will rejoice.
\v 19 For I know that this will turn out to my salvation, through your prayers and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ,
\v 20 according to my earnest expectation and hope, that I will in no way be disappointed, but with all boldness, as always, now also Christ will be magnified in my body, whether by life or by death.
\v 21 For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain.
\v 22 But if I live on in the flesh, this will bring fruit from my work; yet I don’t know what I will choose.
\v 23 But I am hard pressed between the two, having the desire to depart and be with Christ, which is far better.
\v 24 Yet to remain in the flesh is more needful for your sake.
\v 25 Having this confidence, I know that I will remain, yes, and remain with you all for your progress and joy in the faith,
\v 26 that your rejoicing may abound in Christ Jesus in me through my presence with you again.
\p
\v 27 Only let your way of life be worthy of the Good News of Christ, that whether I come and see you or am absent, I may hear of your state, that you stand firm in one spirit, with one soul striving for the faith of the Good News;
\v 28 and in nothing frightened by the adversaries, which is for them a proof of destruction, but to you of salvation, and that from God.
\v 29 Because it has been granted to you on behalf of Christ, not only to believe in him, but also to suffer on his behalf,
\v 30 having the same conflict which you saw in me and now hear is in me.
