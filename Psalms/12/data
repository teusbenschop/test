\c 12
\d For the Chief Musician; upon an eight-stringed lyre. A Psalm of David.
\q1
\v 1 Help, Yahweh; for the godly man ceases.
\q2 For the faithful fail from among the children of men.
\q1
\v 2 Everyone lies to his neighbor.
\q2 They speak with flattering lips, and with a double heart.
\q1
\v 3 May Yahweh cut off all flattering lips,
\q2 and the tongue that boasts,
\q1
\v 4 who have said, “With our tongue we will prevail.
\q2 Our lips are our own.
\q2 Who is lord over us?”
\q1
\v 5 “Because of the oppression of the weak and because of the groaning of the needy,
\q2 I will now arise,” says Yahweh;
\q1 “I will set him in safety from those who malign him.”
\q1
\v 6 Yahweh’s words are flawless words,
\q2 as silver refined in a clay furnace, purified seven times.
\q1
\v 7 You will keep them, Yahweh.
\q2 You will preserve them from this generation forever.
\q1
\v 8 The wicked walk on every side,
\q2 when what is vile is exalted among the sons of men.
