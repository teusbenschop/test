\c 19
\d For the Chief Musician. A Psalm by David.
\q1
\v 1 The heavens declare the glory of God.
\q2 The expanse shows his handiwork.
\q1
\v 2 Day after day they pour out speech,
\q2 and night after night they display knowledge.
\q1
\v 3 There is no speech nor language,
\q2 where their voice is not heard.
\q1
\v 4 Their voice has gone out through all the earth,
\q2 their words to the end of the world.
\q1 In them he has set a tent for the sun,
\q2
\v 5 which is as a bridegroom coming out of his room,
\q2 like a strong man rejoicing to run his course.
\q1
\v 6 His going out is from the end of the heavens,
\q2 his circuit to its ends.
\q2 There is nothing hidden from its heat.
\b
\q1
\v 7 Yahweh’s law is perfect, restoring the soul.
\q2 Yahweh’s covenant is sure, making wise the simple.
\q1
\v 8 Yahweh’s precepts are right, rejoicing the heart.
\q2 Yahweh’s commandment is pure, enlightening the eyes.
\q1
\v 9 The fear of Yahweh is clean, enduring forever.
\q2 Yahweh’s ordinances are true, and righteous altogether.
\q1
\v 10 They are more to be desired than gold, yes, than much fine gold,
\q2 sweeter also than honey and the extract of the honeycomb.
\q1
\v 11 Moreover your servant is warned by them.
\q2 In keeping them there is great reward.
\q1
\v 12 Who can discern his errors?
\q2 Forgive me from hidden errors.
\b
\q1
\v 13 Keep back your servant also from presumptuous sins.
\q2 Let them not have dominion over me.
\q1 Then I will be upright.
\q2 I will be blameless and innocent of great transgression.
\q1
\v 14 Let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart
\q2 be acceptable in your sight,
\q2 Yahweh, my rock, and my redeemer.
