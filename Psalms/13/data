\c 13
\d For the Chief Musician. A Psalm by David.
\q1
\v 1 How long, Yahweh?
\q2 Will you forget me forever?
\q2 How long will you hide your face from me?
\q1
\v 2 How long shall I take counsel in my soul,
\q2 having sorrow in my heart every day?
\q2 How long shall my enemy triumph over me?
\q1
\v 3 Behold, and answer me, Yahweh, my God.
\q2 Give light to my eyes, lest I sleep in death;
\q2
\v 4 lest my enemy say, “I have prevailed against him;”
\q2 lest my adversaries rejoice when I fall.
\b
\q1
\v 5 But I trust in your loving kindness.
\q2 My heart rejoices in your salvation.
\q1
\v 6 I will sing to Yahweh,
\q2 because he has been good to me.
