\c 62
\d For the Chief Musician. To Jeduthun. A Psalm by David.
\q1
\v 1 My soul rests in God alone.
\q2 My salvation is from him.
\q1
\v 2 He alone is my rock, my salvation, and my fortress.
\q2 I will never be greatly shaken.
\q1
\v 3 How long will you assault a man?
\q2 Would all of you throw him down,
\q2 like a leaning wall, like a tottering fence?
\q1
\v 4 They fully intend to throw him down from his lofty place.
\q2 They delight in lies.
\q2 They bless with their mouth, but they curse inwardly. \qs Selah.\qs*
\q1
\v 5 My soul, wait in silence for God alone,
\q2 for my expectation is from him.
\q1
\v 6 He alone is my rock and my salvation, my fortress.
\q2 I will not be shaken.
\q1
\v 7 My salvation and my honor is with God.
\q2 The rock of my strength, and my refuge, is in God.
\q1
\v 8 Trust in him at all times, you people.
\q2 Pour out your heart before him.
\q2 God is a refuge for us. \qs Selah.\qs*
\q1
\v 9 Surely men of low degree are just a breath,
\q2 and men of high degree are a lie.
\q1 In the balances they will go up.
\q2 They are together lighter than a breath.
\q1
\v 10 Don’t trust in oppression.
\q2 Don’t become vain in robbery.
\q1 If riches increase,
\q2 don’t set your heart on them.
\q1
\v 11 God has spoken once;
\q2 twice I have heard this,
\q2 that power belongs to God.
\q1
\v 12 Also to you, Lord, belongs loving kindness,
\q2 for you reward every man according to his work.
