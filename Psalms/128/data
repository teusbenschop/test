\q1
\v 1 Blessed is everyone who fears Yahweh,
\q2 who walks in his ways.
\q1
\v 2 For you will eat the labor of your hands.
\q2 You will be happy, and it will be well with you.
\q1
\v 3 Your wife will be as a fruitful vine in the innermost parts of your house,
\q2 your children like olive plants around your table.
\q1
\v 4 Behold, thus is the man blessed who fears Yahweh.
\q2
\v 5 May Yahweh bless you out of Zion,
\q2 and may you see the good of Jerusalem all the days of your life.
\q1

\q2 Peace be upon Israel.
