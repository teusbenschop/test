\c 82
\d A Psalm by Asaph.
\q1
\v 1 God presides in the great assembly.
\q2 He judges among the gods.
\q1
\v 2 “How long will you judge unjustly,
\q2 and show partiality to the wicked?” \qs Selah.\qs*
\b
\q1
\v 3 “Defend the weak, the poor, and the fatherless.
\q2 Maintain the rights of the poor and oppressed.
\q1
\v 4 Rescue the weak and needy.
\q2 Deliver them out of the hand of the wicked.”
\q1
\v 5 They don’t know, neither do they understand.
\q2 They walk back and forth in darkness.
\q2 All the foundations of the earth are shaken.
\q1
\v 6 I said, “You are gods,
\q2 all of you are sons of the Most High.
\q1
\v 7 Nevertheless you shall die like men,
\q2 and fall like one of the rulers.”
\q1
\v 8 Arise, God, judge the earth,
\q2 for you inherit all of the nations.
