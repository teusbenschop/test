\v 1 Hear my cry, God.
\q2 Listen to my prayer.
\q1
\v 2 From the end of the earth, I will call to you when my heart is overwhelmed.
\q2 Lead me to the rock that is higher than I.
\q1
\v 3 For you have been a refuge for me,
\q2 a strong tower from the enemy.
\q1
\v 4 I will dwell in your tent forever.
\q2 I will take refuge in the shelter of your wings. \qs Selah.\qs*

\v 5 For you, God, have heard my vows.
\q2 You have given me the heritage of those who fear your name.
\q1
\v 6 You will prolong the king’s life.
\q2 His years will be for generations.
\q1
\v 7 He shall be enthroned in God’s presence forever.
\q2 Appoint your loving kindness and truth, that they may preserve him.
\q1
\v 8 So I will sing praise to your name forever,
\q2 that I may fulfill my vows daily.
