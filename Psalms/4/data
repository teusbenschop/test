\v 1 Answer me when I call, God of my righteousness.
\q2 Give me relief from my distress.
\q2 Have mercy on me, and hear my prayer.

\v 2 You sons of men, how long shall my glory be turned into dishonor?
\q2 Will you love vanity and seek after falsehood? \qs Selah.\qs*
\q1
\v 3 But know that Yahweh has set apart for himself him who is godly:
\q2 Yahweh will hear when I call to him.

\v 6 Many say, “Who will show us any good?”
\q2 Yahweh, let the light of your face shine on us.

\v 7 You have put gladness in my heart,
\q2 more than when their grain and their new wine are increased.

\v 8 In peace I will both lay myself down and sleep,
\q2 for you, Yahweh alone, make me live in safety.
