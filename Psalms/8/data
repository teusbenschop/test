\q2 You have set your glory above the heavens!
\q1
\v 2 From the lips of babes and infants you have established strength,
\q2 because of your adversaries, that you might silence the enemy and the avenger.

\v 5 For you have made him a little lower than the angels,\f + \fr 8:5 \ft Hebrew: Elohim. The word Elohim, used here, usually means “God”, but can also mean “gods”, “princes”, or “angels”. The Septuagint reads “angels” here. See also the quote from the Septuagint in Hebrews 2:7.\f*
\q2 and crowned him with glory and honor.
\q1
\v 6 You make him ruler over the works of your hands.
\q2 You have put all things under his feet:
\q1
\v 7 All sheep and cattle,
\q2 yes, and the animals of the field,
\q2
\v 8 the birds of the sky, the fish of the sea,
\q2 and whatever passes through the paths of the seas.
\q1
\v 9 Yahweh, our Lord,
\q2 how majestic is your name in all the earth!
