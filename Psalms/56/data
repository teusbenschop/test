\q1
\v 1 Be merciful to me, God, for man wants to swallow me up.
\q2 All day long, he attacks and oppresses me.
\q1
\v 2 My enemies want to swallow me up all day long,
\q2 for they are many who fight proudly against me.
\q1
\v 3 When I am afraid,
\q2 I will put my trust in you.
\q1
\v 4 In God, I praise his word.
\q2 In God, I put my trust.
\q1 I will not be afraid.
\q2 What can flesh do to me?
\q1
\v 5 All day long they twist my words.
\q2 All their thoughts are against me for evil.
\q1
\v 6 They conspire and lurk,
\q2 watching my steps.
\q2 They are eager to take my life.
\q1
\v 7 Shall they escape by iniquity?
\q2 In anger cast down the peoples, God.
\q1
\v 8 You count my wanderings.
\q2 You put my tears into your container.
\q2 Aren’t they in your book?
\q1
\v 9 Then my enemies shall turn back in the day that I call.
\q2 I know this: that God is for me.
\q1
\v 10 In God, I will praise his word.
\q2 In Yahweh, I will praise his word.
\q1
\v 11 I have put my trust in God.
\q2 I will not be afraid.
\q2 What can man do to me?
\q1
\v 12 Your vows are on me, God.
\q2 I will give thank offerings to you.
\q1
\v 13 For you have delivered my soul from death,
\q2 and prevented my feet from falling,
\q2 that I may walk before God in the light of the living.
