\c 141
\d A Psalm by David.
\q1
\v 1 Yahweh, I have called on you.
\q2 Come to me quickly!
\q2 Listen to my voice when I call to you.
\q1
\v 2 Let my prayer be set before you like incense;
\q2 the lifting up of my hands like the evening sacrifice.
\q1
\v 3 Set a watch, Yahweh, before my mouth.
\q2 Keep the door of my lips.
\q1
\v 4 Don’t incline my heart to any evil thing,
\q2 to practice deeds of wickedness with men who work iniquity.
\q2 Don’t let me eat of their delicacies.
\q1
\v 5 Let the righteous strike me, it is kindness;
\q2 let him reprove me, it is like oil on the head;
\q2 don’t let my head refuse it;
\q2 Yet my prayer is always against evil deeds.
\q1
\v 6 Their judges are thrown down by the sides of the rock.
\q2 They will hear my words, for they are well spoken.
\q1
\v 7 “As when one plows and breaks up the earth,
\q2 our bones are scattered at the mouth of Sheol.”\f + \fr 141:7 \ft Sheol is the place of the dead.\f*
\q1
\v 8 For my eyes are on you, Yahweh, the Lord.
\q2 In you, I take refuge.
\q2 Don’t leave my soul destitute.
\q1
\v 9 Keep me from the snare which they have laid for me,
\q2 from the traps of the workers of iniquity.
\q1
\v 10 Let the wicked fall together into their own nets
\q2 while I pass by.
