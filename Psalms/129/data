\c 129
\d A Song of Ascents.
\q1
\v 1 Many times they have afflicted me from my youth up.
\q2 Let Israel now say,
\q1
\v 2 many times they have afflicted me from my youth up,
\q2 yet they have not prevailed against me.
\q1
\v 3 The plowers plowed on my back.
\q2 They made their furrows long.
\q1
\v 4 Yahweh is righteous.
\q2 He has cut apart the cords of the wicked.
\q1
\v 5 Let them be disappointed and turned backward,
\q2 all those who hate Zion.
\q1
\v 6 Let them be as the grass on the housetops,
\q2 which withers before it grows up,
\q1
\v 7 with which the reaper doesn’t fill his hand,
\q2 nor he who binds sheaves, his bosom.
\q1
\v 8 Neither do those who go by say,
\q2 “The blessing of Yahweh be on you.
\q2 We bless you in Yahweh’s name.”
