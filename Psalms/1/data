\v 1 Blessed is the man who doesn’t walk in the counsel of the wicked,
\q2 nor stand on the path of sinners,
\q2 nor sit in the seat of scoffers;
\q1
\v 2 but his delight is in Yahweh’s\f + \fr 1:2 \ft “Yahweh” is God’s proper Name, sometimes rendered “LORD” (all caps) in other translations.\f* law.
\q2 On his law he meditates day and night.
\q1
\v 3 He will be like a tree planted by the streams of water,
\q2 that produces its fruit in its season,
\q2 whose leaf also does not wither.
\q2 Whatever he does shall prosper.

\v 4 The wicked are not so,
\q2 but are like the chaff which the wind drives away.
\q1
\v 5 Therefore the wicked shall not stand in the judgment,
\q2 nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous.
\q1
\v 6 For Yahweh knows the way of the righteous,
\q2 but the way of the wicked shall perish.
