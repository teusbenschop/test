\q1
\v 11 Sheol\f + \fr 15:11 \ft Sheol is the place of the dead.\f* and Abaddon are before Yahweh—

\q2 but the mouths of fools feed on folly.
\q1

\q2 but one who has a cheerful heart enjoys a continual feast.
\q1
\v 16 Better is little, with the fear of Yahweh,
\q2 than great treasure with trouble.
\q1
\v 17 Better is a dinner of herbs, where love is,
\q2 than a fattened calf with hatred.
\q1
\v 18 A wrathful man stirs up contention,

\q2 but the path of the upright is a highway.
\q1
\v 20 A wise son makes a father glad,
\q2 but a foolish man despises his mother.
\q1
\v 21 Folly is joy to one who is void of wisdom,
\q2 but a man of understanding keeps his way straight.
\q1
\v 22 Where there is no counsel, plans fail;
\q2 but in a multitude of counselors they are established.

\v 23 Joy comes to a man with the reply of his mouth.
\q2 How good is a word at the right time!
\q1
\v 24 The path of life leads upward for the wise,
\q2 to keep him from going downward to Sheol.\f + \fr 15:24 \ft Sheol is the place of the dead.\f*

\v 25 Yahweh will uproot the house of the proud,
\q2 but he will keep the widow’s borders intact.

\q2 but the thoughts of the pure are pleasing.
\q1
\v 27 He who is greedy for gain troubles his own house,
\q2 but he who hates bribes will live.

\q2 but he hears the prayer of the righteous.

\v 30 The light of the eyes rejoices the heart.
\q2 Good news gives health to the bones.
\q1
\v 31 The ear that listens to reproof lives,
\q2 and will be at home among the wise.

\v 33 The fear of Yahweh teaches wisdom.
\q2 Before honor is humility.
