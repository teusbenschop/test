\q2 but when the wicked rule, the people groan.
\q1

\q2 spreads a net for his feet.
\q1

\q2 The wicked aren’t concerned about knowledge.
\q1
\v 8 Mockers stir up a city,
\q2 but wise men turn away anger.
\q1
\v 9 If a wise man goes to court with a foolish man,
\q2 the fool rages or scoffs, and there is no peace.
\q1

\q1
\v 14 The king who fairly judges the poor,
\q2 his throne shall be established forever.
\q1
\v 15 The rod of correction gives wisdom,
\q2 but a child left to himself causes shame to his mother.
\q1
\v 16 When the wicked increase, sin increases;
\q2 but the righteous will see their downfall.
\q1
\v 17 Correct your son, and he will give you peace;
\q2 yes, he will bring delight to your soul.
\q1
\v 18 Where there is no revelation, the people cast off restraint;
\q2 but one who keeps the law is blessed.

\q1
\v 21 He who pampers his servant from youth
\q2 will have him become a son in the end.
\q1

\q2 He takes an oath, but dares not testify.

\q2 but a man’s justice comes from Yahweh.
\q1
\v 27 A dishonest man detests the righteous,
\q2 and the upright in their ways detest the wicked.
