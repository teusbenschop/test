\q1

\q2 but the prudent man carefully considers his ways.
\q1
\v 16 A wise man fears and shuns evil,
\q2 but the fool is hot headed and reckless.
\q1

\q2 but in death, the righteous has a refuge.
\q1
\v 33 Wisdom rests in the heart of one who has understanding,
\q2 and is even made known in the inward part of fools.
\q1

\q2 but his wrath is toward one who causes shame.
