\v 1 And Tobias called Raphael, and said to him,
\v 2 â€œBrother Azarias, take with you a servant and two camels, and go to Rages of Media to Gabael, and receive the money for me, and bring him to the wedding feast,
\v 3 because Raguel has sworn that I must not depart.
\v 4 My father counts the days; and if I wait long, he will be very grieved.
\v 5 So Raphael went on his way, and lodged with Gabael, and gave him the handwriting; so he brought forth the bags with their seals, and gave them to him.
\v 6 Then they rose up early in the morning together, and came to the wedding feast. Tobias blessed his wife.
