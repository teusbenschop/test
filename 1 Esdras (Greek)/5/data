\v 40 for to them said Nehemias and Attharias, that they should not be partakers of the holy things, till there arose up a high priest wearing \f + \fr 5:40 \ft Gr. \fqa the manifestation and truth.\f* Urim and Thummim.

\v 45 and to give into the holy treasury of the works a thousand pounds of gold, five thousand of silver, and a hundred priestly vestments.
\v 46 And the priests and the Levites and those who were of the people lived in Jerusalem and the country; the holy singers also and the gatekeepers and all Israel in their villages.
\p
\v 47 But when the seventh month was at hand, and when the children of Israel were every man in his own place, they came all together with one consent into the broad place before the first porch which is toward the east.
\v 48 Then stood up Jesus the son of Josedek, and his kindred the priests, and Zorobabel the son of Salathiel, and his kindred, and made ready the altar of the God of Israel,
\v 49 to offer burned sacrifices upon it, according as it is expressly commanded in the book of Moses the man of God.
\v 50 And certain were gathered to them out of the other nations of the land, and they erected the altar upon its own place, because all the nations of the land were at enmity with them, and oppressed them; and they offered sacrifices according to the time, and burnt offerings to the Lord both morning and evening.
\v 51 Also they held the feast of tabernacles, as it is commanded in the law, and \add offered\add* sacrifices daily, as was meet:
\v 52 and after that, the continual oblations, and the sacrifices of the Sabbaths, and of the new moons, and of all the consecrated feasts.
\v 53 And all those who had made any vow to God began to offer sacrifices to God from the new moon of the \f + \fr 5:53 \ft Another reading is, \fqa first.\f* seventh month, although the temple of God was not yet built.
\v 54 And they gave money to the masons and carpenters; and meat and drink,
\v 55 and cars to them of Sidon and Tyre, that they should bring cedar trees from Libanus, \add and\add* convey them in floats to the haven of Joppa, according to the commandment which was written for them by Cyrus king of the Persians.
\v 56 And in the second year after his coming to the temple of God at Jerusalem, in the second month, began Zorobabel the son of Salathiel, and Jesus the son of Josedek, and their kindred, and the Levitical priests, and all those who were come to Jerusalem out of the captivity:
\v 57 and they laid the foundation of the temple of God on the new moon of the second month, in the second year after they were come to Jewry and Jerusalem.
\v 58 \x + \xo 5:58 \xt Ezra 3:8-9\x* And they appointed the Levites from twenty years old over the works of the Lord. Then stood up Jesus, and his sons and kindred, and Kadmiel his brother, and the sons of Jesus, Emadabun, and the sons of Joda the son of Iliadun, and their sons and kindred, all the Levites, with one accord started the business, laboring to advance the works in the house of God. So the builders built the temple of the Lord.
\v 59 And the priests stood arrayed in their vestments with musical instruments and trumpets, and the Levites the sons of Asaph with their cymbals,
\v 60 singing songs of thanksgiving, and praising the Lord, after the order of David king of Israel.
\v 61 And they sang aloud, praising the Lord in songs of thanksgiving, because his goodness and his glory are forever in all Israel.
\v 62 And all the people sounded trumpets, and shouted with a loud voice, singing songs of thanksgiving to the Lord for the rearing up of the house of the Lord.
\v 63 \x + \xo 5:63 \xt Ezra 3:12-13\x* Also of the Levitical priests, and of the heads of their families, the ancients who had seen the former house came to the building of this with lamentation and great weeping.
\v 64 But many with trumpets and joy \add shouted\add* with loud voice,
\v 65 insomuch that the people heard not the trumpets for the weeping of the people: for the multitude sounded marvelously, so that it was heard afar off.
\p
\v 66 \x + \xo 5:66 \xt Ezra 4:1\x* Wherefore when the enemies of the tribe of Judah and Benjamin heard it, they came to know what that noise of trumpets should mean.
\v 67 And they perceived that those who were of the captivity did build the temple to the Lord, the God of Israel.
\v 68 So they went to zorobabel and Jesus, and to the chief men of the families, and said to them, we will build together with you.
\v 69 For we likewise, as youÂ°, do obey your Lord, and do sacrifice to him from the days of \f + \fr 5:69 \ft Another reading is, \fqa Asbacaphath.\f* Asbasareth the king of the Assyrians, who brought us here.
\v 70 Then Zorobabel and Jesus and the chief men of the families of Israel said to them, It is not \f + \fr 5:70 \ft Another reading is, \fqa for us and you.\f* for you to build the house to the Lord our God.
\v 71 We ourselves alone will build to the Lord of Israel, according as Cyrus the king of the Persians has commanded us.
\v 72 But the heathen of the land lying heavy upon the inhabitants of Judea, and \f + \fr 5:72 \ft Or, \fqa besieging them\f* holding them strait, hindered their building;
\v 73 and \f + \fr 5:73 \ft Another reading is, \fqa leading the people astray in counsel, and raising commotions.\f* by their secret plots, and popular persuasions and commotions, they hindered the finishing of the building all the time that King Cyrus lived: so they were hindered from building for the space of two years, until the reign of Darius.
